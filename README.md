The minimal rupee change problem considers the question of finding the minimum number of rupee notes of certain denominations that sum up to a given amount of money. The purpose of this project is to make it easier for people who want to exchange the money from big amount to small nominal. And these can be done by using the algorithm called Greedy algorithm.
